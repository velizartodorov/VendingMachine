Building a vending machine in Kotlin because ... why not? 🙂

## How to start? 🤔

1. Make sure you have [azul-13-sdk](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk) installed for
   Kotlin.
2. Go to [Main.kt](src/main/kotlin/Main.kt) and run the `fun main()` function.

## Implementation 🔧

### Functionality ✨

The vending machine works with a list of coins and can also return change. 🧙‍

For now, this basic implementation supports the following types of drinks:

* Americano, Café Au Lait, Cappuccino, Cortado, Decaf, Espresso, Flat White, Iced Coffee, Irish
  Coffee, Latte, Macchiato, Mocha, Tea, Water

### Architecture ⚙️

#### State pattern

The vending machine uses State Pattern and has several states - `Idle`, `Running`, `Paused`
and `Stopped` and the transition goes as follows:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    Idle --> Running : start()
    Running --> Paused : pause()
    Paused --> Running : start()
    Paused --> Stopped : stop()
    Running --> Stopped : stop()
    Stopped --> Running : start()
```

#### Choice of drink 🍶 and container 📥📤

The choice of a drink and container is based on
the [Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_(object-oriented_programming)). All the
drinks and containers implement the sealed interfaces `Drink` and `Container` respectively, and
implement them. With the help
of [sealed interfaces](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/sealed-classes.html#declare-a-sealed-class-or-interface)
in Kotlin, we can avoid the use of pattern matching/`switch`/`if...else` statements and can autoload
new implementations.

For now, there are a few containers - water, beans, tea, milk, and sugar. When a certain container
is chosen, the amount in the container decreases. If the container is empty, an exception is thrown
to notify the user.

## Contribution strategy 🌿

The work is being done directly on the `main` branch. It's a hobby project, so nothing sophisticated
is planned (for now). 😉 In the Git messages you can find the following emojis, meaning:

| Emoji | Action                  |
|:-----:|-------------------------|
|  🔨   | refactoring             |
|   ✨   | feature                 |
|  🐛   | bug fixed               |
|  📚   | update `README.md`      |
|   ✅   | update tests            |
|  🚀   | update building scripts |

## CI/CD 🚀

When a new commit is pushed, a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) pipeline is
triggered. This is acquired by the [build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)
and [tests.yml](.github/workflows/tests.yml) files. Example:
